        description:"Railroad Chinese came primarily \
        from Guangdong province, an area that was accustomed \
        to sending workers overseas for jobs.  Its capital, Guangzhou \
        (Canton), was one of the only treaty ports open to foreigners by the \
        Manchu government.  Beginning with the 1848 Gold Rush, the Chinese came to California. \
        Then later when the Central Pacific needed labor, it sent recruiters \
        there to find workers.  The majority of Chinese came from this area.  (see map)"

        description:"Chinese gangs or groups of 30 men would work and live together. \
        They were paid from $26-$30 per month.  Supervised by a Chinese headman \
        (who worked with a non-Chinese foreman), they ate, slept and worked together.\
         Each gang had its own cook. They worked 6 days a week from dawn to dusk.  \
         Provisions were provided by the same contractors who recruited them — Sisson \
         and Wallace, Koopmanschip.  They ate food that was familiar to their palate: \
         rice, vegetables, dried and fermented foods.Central Pacific arranged with one \
         of the labor contractors, Sisson, Wallace & Company, who had exclusive rights \
         to sell food and other supplies to the Chinese workers. As the work moved through \
         Nevada, the Central Pacific had two train cars labeled “China Store,” from which \
         goods could be purchased. Food was so important that the Chinese cooks were paid \
         more than unskilled workers. A Chinese doctor often accompanied labor teams."

        description:"Foremost is the carving of 15 tunnels through the Sierra Nevada. \
        The largest and most difficult is the Summit Tunnel, which is as long as 5 \
        football fields and 140 feet tall. It took 15 months to complete, spanning 2 \
        of the harshest, coldest, snowiest, windiest Winters (1867, 1868).  Several \
        thousand Chinese established a camp adjacent to the peak, where they lived \
        and worked.  Using hand tools and black powder to blast the granite, they could \
        break through the mountain at the rate of an inch a day.  Working at each end of \
        the tunnel, from the top and inside out, crews worked 24/7.Once the Summit \
        Tunnel was completed, most of the Chinese crews were let go.  The remainder of \
        the line to Promontory was much easier to build and didn’t require the manpower."

        description:"Working conditions were terrible, pay was low, and hours long. The Chinese were \
        also paid less than white workers. On Monday, June 25th, 1867, 3000 Chinese workers between \
        Cisco and Truckee (a distance of approximately 30 miles) went on strike.  The work stoppage \
        terrified the leaders of the Central Pacific, who firmly rejected demands for higher wages and \
        shorter work days.  The company desperately explored options of replacing workers with Native \
        Americans, freed blacks, and new Chinese recruits. Ultimately, the strike ended because the \
        Central Pacific stopped access to food. While the strike was unsuccessful, the Central Pacific \
        did increase their pay and decrease work hours. The strike demonstrated the Chinese workers' \
        ability to communicate, organize, and act as one.",

        description:"Sometime in 1868, Union Pacific crews laid 8 miles of track in one day. The \
        Central Pacific was determined to outdo this feat. Charles Crocker made a \
        $10,000 wager with Thomas Durant that the Central Pacific could lay more \
        track. On April 28, 1869, the Central Pacific successfully laid 10 miles of \
        track, a record that hasn’t been matched or broken since. This was achieved \
        by using several thousand Chinese workers, 8 Irish track layers, and a supply \
        train that was ready for every task. The planning and organization that went \
        into the effort was a sight to see. All the material, equipment, and tools \
        were at hand for every task. It is no wonder that the performance has never \
        been equaled."
